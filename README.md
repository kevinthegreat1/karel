> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you need to override the `main` method in your class for IntelliJ to correctly detect it as a program. The following step might not be necessary in Java 25 or above.

5. Add the following snippet to your class:
```java
    @Override
    public void main(String[] args) {
        super.main(args);
    }
```
You are now ready to write and run your Karel or ACM program.
